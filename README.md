## Stakeholders

Omar Qassab is a biology graduate student at NYU, and a graduate assistant at the University Learning Center (ULC). He has been working with the ULC for three years, and has noticed in his time there a few inefficiencies in the system that the ULC uses—ones that can potentially be solved by this app.


### Problems/Frustrations:

#### LAs/Admin:
- Consolidation of necessary information is difficult considering the use of various different apps
- Navigating through each of these apps to find all the required functions and information for each LA is time-consuming and confusing
- ULC newsletter isn’t very prominent

#### Students:
- Students mentioned not knowing the current wait time and traffic at the center before taking the time to commute there. 
- After checking in, students do not have an accurate estimated wait time, how many people are in line before them, when it is their turn with an available tutor, so they cannot leave for extended periods of time.


### Goals/Needs:

#### LAs/Admin:
- App should function as a hub for all necessary functions/info
- Icons should be displayed on the homepage, similarly to the NYU Mobile app
- App should be able to display ULC newsletter

#### Students:
- Having students fill out the current Google Form on their personal devices for increased efficiency and to allow IA’s to have an earlier idea of the traffic and set up sessions.
- Students would like a better gauge of wait times (similar to the traffic tracker of restaurants on Google Maps showing different times of the day during different days of the week).

## Activity Diagrams

### UML Activity Diagrams

- As a student, I want to know how busy each location is in real time so that I could better plan my schedule.
